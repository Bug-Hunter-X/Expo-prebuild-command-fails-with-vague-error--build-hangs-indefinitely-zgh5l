While building an Expo app, I encountered an error related to the `expo prebuild` command.  The error message was vague, indicating a general failure but not specifying the root cause. The build process would hang indefinitely, eventually timing out. My project uses several custom native modules and complex configurations.  I tried cleaning the cache, reinstalling dependencies, and checking for conflicting packages; however, none of these solved the issue.
