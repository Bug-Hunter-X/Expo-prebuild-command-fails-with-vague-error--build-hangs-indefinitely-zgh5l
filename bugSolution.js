// Solution might involve a deep dive into the build logs, or incremental changes to resolve conflicting dependencies or configuration issues within the native modules.  This is often a process of elimination and close inspection of logs.
// Example (Illustrative - not a guaranteed solution):
// ... (Analysis of build logs, version checks, dependency resolution)...
// This is highly project-specific and no single solution exists here.
// Consider carefully reviewing Expo documentation regarding native modules and potential build issues.
