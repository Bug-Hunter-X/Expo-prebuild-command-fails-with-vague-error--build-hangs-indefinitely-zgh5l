# Expo prebuild Failure - Indefinite Hang

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with the `expo prebuild` command in Expo CLI. The build process hangs indefinitely, providing no specific error details to aid in debugging.

## Bug Description

The `expo prebuild` command fails without a clear error message.  The build process hangs, and no progress is shown.  This occurs even after attempting standard troubleshooting steps such as cache clearing and dependency reinstallation.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run `expo prebuild`.

The build process should hang indefinitely.

## Potential Causes

The root cause is likely related to a complex interaction between custom native modules, project configuration, or Expo's internal build process.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

The solution might involve identifying and resolving conflicts within the project's configurations, such as native module dependencies or conflicting package versions. A detailed analysis of the Expo build logs (if accessible) could shed light on the root cause.  Often, incremental changes in the project configuration, while painstaking, can narrow down the problem area.  It may involve examining the native iOS and Android projects more closely.
